        <h3 style="text-align:center;">About Vedic Mathematics</h3>
       <p> Vedic maths is a collection of ancient Indian techniques, which enable us to  solve math problems quickly and easily. It originated from India and was found in ancient scriptures called “Vedas”. These Vedas were written as early as 10 centuries ago, since they were estimated to be written during the 1500 to 500 BCE. Vedas are written in sanskrit, which was the language that almost all Indian languages were derived from. Later, in 1911 and 1918, an Indian mathematician: Jagadguru Shri Bharathi Krishna Thirtaji rediscovered these scriptures and published them as a book. </p>

       <p> The collection of ancient techniques are made up of 16 sutras (or formulae), which can be used to solve various arithmetic, algebraic, geometric, etc. problems. The best part about these methods, is that they are very simple to understand, and are fairly easy to remember. They follow the way a person’s mind thinks while solving a problem, unlike the formulae that you have to just memorize without being able to understand it. </p>
        
       <p> In this website, you will be able to learn vedic maths techniques on complicated addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Do not fear, for vedic maths will save you during your exams! </p>
        
       <p> Fun fact: the word ‘Veda’ means ‘Knowledge’ in Sanskrit! </p>

            <p>

                 
                Hi! My name is Rishika, I was born and raised in Finland, and have been surounded by an international community my entire life. I am a 9th grader at Espoo international School (EIS), and this website is the product of my Personal Project, which is self-driven and independently done as a part of the IB curriculum. This project was the perfect opportunity for me to explore the field of Vedic mathematics in a more comprehensive and detailed manner. 
              </p> 
             <p>My parents used to tell me a lot about Indian culture and history when I was younger, moreover they used to (and still do) tell me stories from the Indian epics. Besides my knowlegde on the culture and epics, I had heard a little bit about Vedic maths, but we hadn't really discussed it. Then during the beginning of 2020, I was reintroduced to Vedic maths and started to actually learn about it.

              
            </p>  
                
                
            <p>   <h3 style="text-align:center;">What inspired me to create this website?</h3> 
                
                I took some classes during the start of 2020 on vedic maths, which got me really interested in these unique methods of calculation. Knowing that such amazing and simple methods of calculating complex problems came from India, my country of origin, it made me want to explore Vedic maths deeper. What better way is there to learn something, than to teach it to someone! So I decided to use my knowledge from those courses to create a platform where people could access a variety of tutorials on simple Vedic techniques.
